> Web component JS frameworks quick overview by their syntax and features

## Why ?

Many JS developers don't have a good overview of every existing JS framework with their own syntax and features.
How do we solve this ? Developers love having framework overview by examples. It's a quick introduction before going deeper.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Website (built with Astro)
- [ ] Add SolidJS support
- [ ] Add Angular support
- [ ] Add Preact support
- [ ] Add Alpine support
- [x] Add React support
- [x] Add Svelte support
- [x] Add Vue 3 support
